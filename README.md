### **NOTICE:** Development is now on HOLD. I have moved on from this project for now, although I may return to it in the future.

# Features
### Events Tracker
The Events Tracker utility tracks active and inactive world events and helps users keep track of which events have been completed for the day.

### Event Notifications
Event Notifications are pop-up messages shown when a world event is about to start.

### Zone Completion Assistant
The Zone Completion Assistant displays real-time distance and direction information for zone completion points/locations with several options for keeping track of unlocked locations.

### Dungeon Tracker
The Dungeon Tracker is a tool used to keep track of what dungeon paths have been completed for the day while providing some basic information about each dungeon and dungeon path.

### Dungeon Timer
The Dungeon Timer is a tool designed to time dungeon runs. While not meant to be a timer for "official" speed runs, it can be used for practice or as a tool to challenge yourself.

### WvW Tracker
The WvW Tracker overlay displays all objectives in the current player's WvW map with information such as current owner, estimated time-distance to the objective, and the current [RI](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Righteous_Indignation) RI timer value.

### WvW Notifications
WvW Notifications are pop-up messages shown when an objective (keep/tower/camp, etc) has been captured in one of the WvW maps. Several options are available to customize when notifications are shown.

### Trading Post Calculator
The Trading Post Calculator is a tool used to calculate profit, taxes, and break-even prices for buying/selling items on the in-game Trading Post.

### Trading Post Price Tracker
This tool allows you to continuously track/view the Highest Buy Order and Lowest Sell Listings for items without having to open the Trading Post window or visit a separate website. It includes various sort options and a basic historical data graph for viewing the change in prices for an item.

### Trading Post Price Notifications
Price Notifications are messages that appear when an item has reached a certain highest Buy Order or lowest Sale Listing in the Trading Post. Want to know when the price of Dawn has dropped below a certain value, or when Copper Ore's Buy Orders reach a specific price? This tool will notify you of the change in price.

### Tasks Tracker
The Tasks Tracker is a generic tool for keeping track of your own personal in-game tasks. Tasks can include anything from daily crafting to gathering nodes, and include customization of icon, name, description, daily reset, and location. Tasks are stored in xml format and can be loaded or exported for sharing with others.

### Teamspeak Overlay
The Teamspeak Overlay is an overlay that uses the ClientQuery plugin of Teamspeak show when someone talks, sends a chat, or enters/exits the current channel. The tool also allows the user to change channel and send chat messages.

### Web Browser (Optional)
For all needs not provided by the other overlay windows, the Web Browser allows a user to look up guides, videos, or anything else.
